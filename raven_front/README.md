# raven_front

Ravencoin mobile app for Android and iOS, using Flutter.

Note that the "back end" is at https://github.com/moontreeapp/raven_back.

## Development

You will need the latest Flutter development kit.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Next, create an empty directory. It will hold the following projects:

- raven_front
- raven_back
- raven_electrum
- ravencoin_wallet
- reservoir

Then, clone each project inside the empty directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:moontreeapp/raven_front.git
git clone git@github.com:moontreeapp/raven_back.git
git clone git@github.com:moontreeapp/raven_electrum.git
git clone git@github.com:moontreeapp/ravencoin_wallet.git
git clone git@github.com:moontreeapp/reservoir.git
```

Finally, start your Android or IOS emulator, and run the app on your emulator:

```
cd raven_front
flutter run
```
